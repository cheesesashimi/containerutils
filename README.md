# containerutils

This repo contains utilities that I found myself longing for when trying to build containers. For now, there is only the `get-arch` utility.

`artisan` is a half-baked idea around creating a more declarative version of my Containerfiles [build script](https://github.com/cheesesashimi/containerfiles/blob/main/build-and-push-containers.py).
